# UFOs
Using data on different UFO encounters throughout (largely) the United States, the development of an interactive webpage allows the users to investigate cases based on a set of criteria.  Using Javascript as the primary language and CSS with HTML, one produces a visually appealing, easy to use, and simple page carrying lots of information.
RESULTS  The webpage shows a very appealing format with a dark background and bright white text which is easy to see.  A background image behind the title adds a strong visual appeal overall.  At the bottom of the page there are five data search boxes and a detailed table of all data included in the data.js file.  In order to search for specific encounters, one can enter either one or many search critera by typing them into the boxes on the left:

# UFOs
Using data on different UFO encounters throughout (largely) the United States, the development of an interactive webpage allows the users to investigate cases based on a set of criteria.  With Javascript as the primary language and CSS with HTML, one produces a visually appealing, easy to use, and simple page carrying lots of information.  

The webpage shows a very appealing format with a dark background and bright white text which is easy to see.  A background image behind the title adds a strong visual appeal overall.  At the bottom of the page there are five data search boxes and a detailed table of all data included in the data.js file.  In order to search for specific encounters, one can enter either one or many search critera by typing them into the boxes on the left:

In summary, it is a very appealing beginning to an interactive website!  One important piece of a strong and appealing website however, is to have maximum interaction with users.  It is therefore missing a chat feature where users can leave questions, comments and observations back and forth.  A reference column or specific section for news articles that have been uploaded would also be a great strength for a website such as this.  As a drawback however, I would observe that the data table is not in a container of its own.  Therefore as the data increases, the webpage itself gets longer and longer and longer.  A compressed compartment for the table may be a better solution for the page as a whole.
